These tokens represent their share of the total pool. For example, if Pool #1 is the OSMO&lt;&gt;ATOM pool, users can deposit OSMO and ATOM tokens into the pool and receive back Pool1 share tokens. These tokens do not correspond to an exact quantity of tokens, but rather the proportional ownership of the pool. When users remove their liquidity from the pool, they get back the percentage of liquidity that their LP tokens represent. Since buying and selling from the pool changes the quantities of assets within a pool, users are highly unlikely to withdraw the same amount of each token that they initially deposited. They usually receive more of one and less of another, based on the trades executed from the pool.</p><h2 id="liquidity-mining" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#liquidity-mining" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Liquidity Mining</h2>',4),o=(0,n.Uk)("Liquidity mining (also called yield farming) is when users earn tokens for providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol.

However, they are also risking a scenario in which they would have been better off holding the assets rather than supplying them. This outcome is called impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is the difference in net worth between HODLing and LPing. Liquidity mining helps to offset impermanent loss for LPs. When the price of the assets in the pool change at different rates, LPs end up owning larger amounts of the asset that increased less in price (or decreased more in price). For example, if the price of OSMO moons relative to ATOM, LPs in the OSMO-ATOM pool end up with larger portions of the less valuable asset (ATOM). [IMG3] Impermanent loss is mitigated in part by the transaction fees earned by LPs. When the profits made from swap fees outweigh an LP’s impermanent loss, the pool is self-sustainable. To further offset impermanent loss, particularly in the early stages of a protocol when volatility is high, AMMs utilize liquidity mining rewards. Liquidity rewards bootstrap the ecosystem as usage and fee revenues are still ramping up. Osmosis also has many new features and innovations in development to decrease impermanent loss as well.",-1),c=(0,n._)("h2",{id:"long-term-liquidity",tabindex:"-1"},[(0,n._)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#long-term-liquidity","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),(0,n.Uk)(" Long-Term Liquidity")],-1),u=(0,n.Uk)("Liquidity mining rewards tend to attract short-term “mercenary farmers” who quickly deposit and withdraw their liquidity after harvesting the yield.

Mercenary farmers often create the mirage of protocol adoption, but when these farmers leave, it results in significant liquidity volatility.
